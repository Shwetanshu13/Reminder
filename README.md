# Reminder
This is a simple python project, where I can write my reminding tasks on the 'databse' named excel sheet and whenever I run the program, it notifies me if I have a task at that minute.
The project can also automatically be run at an interval of 5 minutes with the help of Task Scheduler like applications. 
The idea of the project can also be used for accounting the birthdays of your loved ones. To notify something important to you and so on.....
